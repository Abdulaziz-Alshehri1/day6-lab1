Hint: Layers do not participate in Auto Layout in the same way that views do. Layers that you create yourself do not automatically update their size when the view size changes, but the view's default layer does. You can tell the system to use a different class for a UIView's layer by overriding its layerClass property.

2. Task 2 : your task is to continue to work on the project and create a user interface. When a user taps any of the buttons, the app displays the same Hello World message.

3. Task 3: All you need you to do is add two  emoji labels to the view. the Figure below shows the expected result. 

Hint, the "smiling face" emoji label should be 33 points away from the top anchor of the safe area, and centered horizontally.
The "ghost" label has two spacing constraints.
You can adjust the font size of the label by editing its Font option in the Attributes inspector
