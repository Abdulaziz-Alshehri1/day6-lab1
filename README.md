Hint: Layers do not participate in Auto Layout in the same way that views do. Layers that you create yourself do not automatically update their size when the view size changes, but the view's default layer does. You can tell the system to use a different class for a UIView's layer by overriding its layerClass property.

2. Task 2 : your task is to continue to work on the project and create a user interface. When a user taps any of the buttons, the app displays the same Hello World message.
