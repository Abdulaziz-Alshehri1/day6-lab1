Hint: Layers do not participate in Auto Layout in the same way that views do. Layers that you create yourself do not automatically update their size when the view size changes, but the view's default layer does. You can tell the system to use a different class for a UIView's layer by overriding its layerClass property.


Task 2 : Your contacts are displayed in a table view. Another example is the Mail app. It uses a table view to display your mail boxes and emails. Not only designed for listing textual data, table view allows you to present the data in the form of images. The TED, Google+ and Airbnb are also good examples. Build a simple table-based app using UITableView
